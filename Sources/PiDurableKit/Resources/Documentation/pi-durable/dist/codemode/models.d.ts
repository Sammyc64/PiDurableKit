/**
 * `models.*` for code mode scripts, copied from the coding agent's code mode: the model catalog, and classifier and
 * image model calls.
 *
 * The catalog functions are host globals, journaled like any global. `models.classify()` and `models.generateImages()`
 * are paid effects, so each runs as an internal tool (`callers: ["tools"]`, a reserved name, hidden from scripts'
 * tool listings): a nested durable call with its own task, live row, abort, usage accounting, and replay policy. The
 * code mode tool turns a script's call of the global into a call of that tool.
